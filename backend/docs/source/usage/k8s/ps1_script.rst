Kubernetes Powershell Script
============================

A Windows Powershell script ``k8s.ps1`` is provided that automates most of the steps in the
:doc:`Kubernetes General Commands <general_cmds>` section.

This script automates the below steps from the
:doc:`Kubernetes General Commands <general_cmds>` section.

- Sets up the environment for `kubectl` if not already set.
- Automatically sets up the configuration using the `.env` file if not already set.
- Option to build the Docker images and run Pods in one go.
- Option to expose the React UI and forward the port for either the production build
  using NGINX server or the React development server.
- Wait for the API backend to startup before exposing the React UI.
- Delete the Kubernetes cluster and wait for all the pods to terminate before showing
  confirmation for the delete operation.


Minikube Installation
---------------------

Follow the installation and starting instructions :ref:`here <general-minikube-installation>`
for Minikube.

Install kubectl
---------------

Follow the installation instructions :ref:`here <general-install-kubectl>` for kubectl.

NGINX Production Build Server
-----------------------------

With Building Images
++++++++++++++++++++

This part should be done with the ``-build`` switch if running for the first time.
All subsequent runs will not require building images unless there is any change in
the source code. It will take sometime to build the images for the first time.

This exposes the production build using NGINX server by default if the ``-dev`` switch
is not provided.

To build the images and run in one go, run the below command.

Without Building Images
+++++++++++++++++++++++

If the images are already built, the ``k8s.ps1`` script can be run directly
without the ``-build`` switch.

If the shell environment was already set before, the script will not attempt to set
it up again in subsequent runs in the same shell session.

React Development Server
------------------------

To use React's built in development server to expose its UI use the ``-dev`` switch.
This can be used in combination with the ``-build`` switch to build the images before
exposing the service.

-----------------------------

The previous steps only shut down the forwarding of traffic to `localhost`.

To shutdown and delete the Kubernetes cluster use the following.

.. code-block::

    currency-converter-api> .\k8s.ps1 -delete
    â–¶ Deleting deployments...
    â–¶ Waiting for pods to terminate...
    âœ… Pods terminated!

    â–¶ Deleting configuration...
    âœ… Configuration deleted!
